Message	: So this Asian escort followed me on instagram. Oh how i wish i was you. Eating a sorts of fancy fish every day. I used to rely on primarily fish as a dietary staple, but nowadays fish, and all sorts of seafood are factory farmed, mega expensive, mislabeled fish-shaped plates of mercury. We gonna run out of fish, before we run out of beef for sure. And then, we will have ground insect patties shaped to look like hamburgers to turn to. I will have every fresh salmon, tuna, squid, crab and lobster before that damn day happens. You fuckers talk of SHTF situations and looting the gun store? Im going to drive my car straight through the barricades of the fish market.

Message	: https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/13924/freeradius-is-trwtf/26 Pre fucking cisely my point. Configuring FreeRADIUS when you are NOT A ISP is a retarded exercise. No wonder the standard tactic is to capture handshakes transmitted to the hotspot. And then crack the hash with a dictionary attack.

Message	: Lets see from what i have learned from my reconnaissance mission. 1. The routers surrounding the P&P office are CLOAKED. Which isnt a problem for me. I can decloak it as much as i like. 2. Cisco makes and/or maintains the routers, as shown by their MAC addresses. 3. The signal easily overlaps out of the office by a few city blocks. Making the area under the freeway bridge the perfect place to conduct replay attacks. 4. The cipher is Enterprise/MGT, PEAP. Supposedly uncrackable. Until you generate your own free RADIUS server and trick someone to connecting. 5. I already got part 4 completed. Just gonna wait for my secret attack date before i start off.
